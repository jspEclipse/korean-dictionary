# How it was made
the first problem that came up was where I was going to get the data for this site. I then remembered that
there was a Community made Anki Deck that held flash cards for around 5,000 core korean words.

I then had to convert the file into JSON and then design the website, which took design aspects of the korean
flag.

# Features
There is a search feature so that you can look for cards through their English, Korean, Romanization translations

# Current Problems
currently not mobile friendly.
the pop up card that shows the whole card should disappear once the card itself disappears from the User Searching.
